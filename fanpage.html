        <h2>Bio</h2>

           <p class="successful"> Boyzone was Europe's most successful boy band during the second half of the 1990s. Comprised of five vocalists and funded by music manager Louis Walsh, the group embraced a similar style of pop music as Take That, whose breakup in 1996 created a void that Boyzone happily filled.

            In 2018 saw the group's return and they signed a deal with Warner for a studio album and nationwide arena tour. Billed as their final release, the aptly titled Thank You & Goodnight found the group delivering a more contemporary sound, and featured songwriting credits from the likes of Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith, and Gary Barlow.
